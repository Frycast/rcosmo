## TESTS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED


# construct a CMBDataFrame, check it has the right class and other attributes
# do this for all types of CMBDataFrame including no coords and NA intensities.
# Then get a window of that CMBDataFrame
# and check that the window has the right attributes etc. Do this for all
# types of windows. Test all the attribute functions here too.
# Do everything with and without unexpected extra columns attached.
# Check that attributes aren't dropped with cmbdf[i,], cmbdf[,j] and cmbdf[i],
# and that pix are maintained.

# Check all generics like cbind and rbind
