\title{Restrict a \code{\link{CMBDataFrame}} to a \code{\link{CMBWindow}}}
\usage{
subWindow(cmbdf, win, intersect)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmbdf}{a CMBDataFrame}

\item{win}{a CMBWindow or a list of CMBWindows}

\item{intersect}{a boolean that determines
the behaviour when \code{win} is a list (see details).}
}
\value{
a CMBDataFrame which is restricted to the
region of the sky specified by \code{win}
}
\description{
A single CMBWindow or a list of CMBWindows can be passed to the \code{win}
argument
}
\details{
Windows that are tagged with \code{set.minus} (see \code{\link{CMBWindow}})
are treated differently from other windows: Let \eqn{A} be the union of the
interiors of all windows whose winType does not include "minus",
and let \eqn{B} be the intersection of the exteriors of all the windows whose
\code{winType} does include "minus". Then, provided that
\code{intersect = TRUE} (the default), the returned CMBDataFrame will
be the intersection of the points in \code{cmbdf} with \eqn{A} and \eqn{B}.
Otherwise, if \code{intersect = FALSE}, the returned CMBDataFrame will
be the intersection of the points in \code{cmbdf} with the union of
\eqn{A} and \eqn{B}.
Note that if \eqn{A} (resp. \eqn{B}) is empty
then the returned CMBDataFrame will be the intersection of \eqn{B}
(resp. \eqn{A}) with \code{cmbdf}.
